GitHub tutorial

Hi fine world!

I'm new to GitHub, so checking things out.  While I don't code every day, I do have a 2 year technical diploma as well as my bachelor of science 4 year in Computer Science. I've always enjoyed any of the coding projects I've been involved in through school as well as at my place of employment, however in my current position I manager server hardware, storage and our corporate SAN.

:)
